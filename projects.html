                              <p>This research project was developed in an effort to provide mobility to infants who are disabled by conditions such as cerebral palsy and Down syndrome. Pioneer3 MobileRobots are used in combination with a Wii balance board which moves in the direction in which the child shifts their weight. Research is ongoing and cross-departmental, headed by Sharon Stansfield (Computer Science), Carole Dennis (Occupational Therapy), and Hélène Larin (Physical Therapy).<br><br>As a research assistant to Professor Stansfield, I worked on refining the software that works on the Pioneer3, as well as improving its efficiency. I also worked on the newly purchased PowerBot (also from MobileRobots). In addition, I assisted the PT and OT departments in recording research sessions.</p>

                              <p>This research project was developed by Professor Nathan Prestopnik in an effort to create a Spanish language learning video game. I joined this research team in August of 2015, but Arena is in its third iteration of development. It was initially inspired by the concept of playing Skyrim in another language and using gameplay and communication with NPCs to learn this language.<br><br>I work with the team as a whole, which varies but is usually eight students, as well as in small, focused groups. I focus on game design, including plotlines and developing immersion in users. I am also working in Phaser to implement a new version of dialogue with NPCs including transitions and vocabulary mini games.</p>
